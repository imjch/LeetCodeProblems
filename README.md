LeetCodeProblems
================

This repoditory contrains my own solutions of problems in [LeetCode](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/).
By the way,the leetcode is the most friendly OJ system I have ever seen!:)
You know...after all,it is just a test,I won't spend my time on making the solutions(code) better.So...I hope you could give some suggestions to me.But I won't accept them~~~hah~hah~hah~hah~hah~;p
